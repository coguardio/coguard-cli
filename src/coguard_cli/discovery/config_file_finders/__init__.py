    sub_path/file-name
    ```

    remains. If `sub_path` has less than three folders in its path, the first key of subpath is
    the key under which the file is being stored in the end. If there are three or more
    folders, say a/b/c, we are cutting off b/c and assume that
    files which have a in common belong together, and the key in the dictionary
    is `a`. If there are keys in the final dictionary that are prefixes of each other,
    these keys are amalgamated in the end.

    Example:

    Say you have a list of files

    ```
    "/etc/foo/bar/foo.txt",
    "/etc/foo/bar/bar.txt",
    "/etc/foo/bar/baz/biz/foo.txt",
    "/etc/foo/bor/boz/bez/biz.txt",
    "/etc/bla.txt"
    ```

    The resulting dictionary in the end should be

    ```
    {
        "foo": [
            "/etc/foo/bar/foo.txt",
            "/etc/foo/bar/bar.txt",
            "/etc/foo/bar/baz/biz/foo.txt",
            "/etc/foo/bor/boz/bez/biz.txt"
        ],
        "": [
            "/etc/bla.txt"
        ]
    }
